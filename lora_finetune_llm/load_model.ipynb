      "<s>[INST] What is AFib? [/INST] AFib is an arrhythmia that affects the electrical activity of the heart. In people with AFib, the heart's electrical conduction system is abnormally fast, causing the heart to beat too quickly. AFib is characterized by an irregular, rapid heart rate with a normal or slightly decreased heart rate on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). The irregular heartbeat is often described as a \"skipped beat\" or \"flutter.\" The rapid heartbeat is usually not life-threatening, but can cause symptoms such as palpitations, fatigue, shortness of breath, and chest pain. AFib is a common heart condition that affects up to 4% of people over the age of 65 and up to 20% of people over the age of 40. It is most commonly seen in people over the age of 60, and is more common in men than women. AFib is often associated with other heart conditions, such as coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, and atrial myxoma. The risk of developing AFib is higher in people who have a history of high blood pressure, diabetes, or a history of heart attack. The exact cause of AFib is unknown, but it is thought to be related to the way in which electrical signals are transmitted through the heart. It is a type of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and is often referred to as a \"fast heart rate.\" AFib is a type of arrhythmia, which is a disturbance in the normal electrical activity of the heart. The irregular heartbeat is usually caused by an abnormality in the electrical conduction system of the heart, which is the electrical pathway that allows the heart to beat.\n",
