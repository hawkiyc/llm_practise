      "Malaria is a serious and sometimes life-threatening disease that is most commonly transmitted by an infected female Anopheles mosquito. The disease is caused by a parasite, specifically Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, or Plasmodium malariae. Malaria is usually found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The disease can be diagnosed through a blood test. Symptoms of malaria include fever, chills, and flu-like symptoms. In severe cases, malaria can cause coma, and death if left untreated. If treated promptly with antimalarial medication, the disease usually has a good prognosis. In areas where malaria is common, preventive medication can be taken. In areas where the disease is common, mosquito nets can be used to prevent bites. In areas where the disease is rare, travelers can take preventive medication. In areas where the disease is common, bed nets with insecticide can be used. The nets should be washed every six months. Mosquitoes that transmit malaria typically bite between nightfall and dawn. Mosquitoes that bite during the day are not typically carriers of malaria. Mosquitoes that bite during the day are typically carriers of dengue fever. In some areas, it may be necessary to use mosquito nets in addition to using mosquito repellent. Mosquito nets that are treated with permethrin are more effective than untreated nets. Mosquito repellents such as DEET, picaridin, and oil of lemon eucalyptus can be used to prevent bites. Mosquito repellents can be applied to clothing. Mosquito repellents can also be applied to skin. Mosquito repellents can be applied to the skin before going outside. Mosquito repellents can be applied to the skin after going outside. Mosquito repellents should be reapplied after swimming or sweating. Mosquito repellents should not be used by children under the age of two. Mosquito repellents should not be applied to the hands or face of children under the age of two.

      " Bursitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of a bursa, which is a fluid-filled sac, usually located near the joints that cushion and reduce friction between bone and soft tissue. The most commonly affected bursae are the subacromial, olecranon, prepatellar, infrapatellar, and retrocalcaneal bursae.  The inflammation is usually caused by repetitive trauma or friction to the affected area, and is sometimes accompanied by infection. Bursitis can be diagnosed with physical examination, X-ray, and ultrasound, and treatment depends on the severity of symptoms and underlying cause, and may include rest, ice, compression, elevation, pain management, and aspiration of the bursa. The symptoms of bursitis may be accompanied by fever, redness, swelling, and warmth in the affected area.
