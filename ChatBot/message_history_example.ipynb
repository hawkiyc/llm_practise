      "**Wrap Function in Python: Introduction**\n",
      "=====================================================\n",
      "\n",
      "In Python, a wrap function (also known as a decorator) is a design pattern that allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure. It's a way to \"wrap\" another function in order to extend the behavior of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How Wrap Function Works**\n",
      "---------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a step-by-step explanation of how a wrap function works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Define a wrap function**: You define a function that takes another function as an argument.\n",
      "2.  **Define a nested function**: Inside the wrap function, you define a nested function that calls the original function.\n",
      "3.  **Add new behavior**: Before or after calling the original function, you can add new behavior to the nested function.\n",
      "4.  **Return the nested function**: The wrap function returns the nested function.\n",
      "5.  **Apply the wrap function**: You apply the wrap function to an existing function using the `@` symbol.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Code**\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an example of a simple wrap function that adds a logging feature to an existing function:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def my_logger(original_function):\n",
      "    \"\"\"\n",
      "    A wrap function that logs the execution of a function.\n",
      "    \"\"\"\n",
      "    def wrapper_function(*args, **kwargs):\n",
      "        \"\"\"\n",
      "        A nested function that calls the original function and logs its execution.\n",
      "        \"\"\"\n",
      "        print(f\"{original_function.__name__} is started.\")\n",
      "        result = original_function(*args, **kwargs)\n",
      "        print(f\"{original_function.__name__} is ended.\")\n",
      "        return result\n",
      "    return wrapper_function\n",
      "\n",
      "# Apply the wrap function to an existing function\n",
      "@my_logger\n",
      "def add(a, b):\n",
      "    \"\"\"\n",
      "    An existing function that adds two numbers.\n",
      "    \"\"\"\n",
      "    return a + b\n",
      "\n",
      "# Test the wrapped function\n",
      "result = add(2, 3)\n",
      "print(f\"Result: {result}\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Output**\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "add is started.\n",
      "add is ended.\n",
      "Result: 5\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Real-World Use Cases**\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Wrap functions have many real-world use cases, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Logging**: Add logging features to existing functions to track their execution.\n",
      "*   **Authentication**: Add authentication checks to existing functions to restrict access.\n",
      "*   **Error handling**: Add error handling to existing functions to handle exceptions.\n",
      "*   **Caching**: Add caching to existing functions to improve performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "By using wrap functions, you can extend the behavior of existing functions without modifying their structure, making your code more flexible and maintainable.\n"

      "**Decorators and Wrap Functions**\n",
      "================================\n",
      "\n",
      "In Python, a decorator is a small function that takes another function as an argument and extends the behavior of the latter function without permanently modifying it.\n",
      "\n",
      "While a wrap function is a specific design pattern that involves defining a nested function inside a decorator, not all decorators require a wrap function. However, most decorators do use a wrap function to extend the behavior of the original function.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Types of Decorators**\n",
      "------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two main types of decorators:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Simple Decorators**: These decorators do not use a wrap function. Instead, they simply return a new function that replaces the original function.\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```python\n",
      "def simple_decorator(func):\n",
      "    def new_func():\n",
      "        return \"Hello, world!\"\n",
      "    return new_func\n",
      "\n",
      "@simple_decorator\n",
      "def original_func():\n",
      "    return \"Original function\"\n",
      "\n",
      "print(original_func())  # Output: Hello, world!\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "    In this example, the `simple_decorator` function returns a new function `new_func` that replaces the original function `original_func`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Decorators with Wrap Functions**: These decorators use a wrap function to extend the behavior of the original function.\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```python\n",
      "def decorator_with_wrap(func):\n",
      "    def wrap(*args, **kwargs):\n",
      "        print(\"Before calling the original function\")\n",
      "        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n",
      "        print(\"After calling the original function\")\n",
      "        return result\n",
      "    return wrap\n",
      "\n",
      "@decorator_with_wrap\n",
      "def original_func():\n",
      "    return \"Original function\"\n",
      "\n",
      "print(original_func())  # Output: Before calling the original function, Original function, After calling the original function\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "    In this example, the `decorator_with_wrap` function returns a wrap function `wrap` that extends the behavior of the original function `original_func`.\n",
      "\n",
      "**When to Use a Wrap Function**\n",
      "------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "While it's possible to write decorators without a wrap function, using a wrap function is often the preferred approach. Here are some scenarios where a wrap function is particularly useful:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Adding pre- and post-execution logic**: A wrap function allows you to add code that runs before and after the original function is executed.\n",
      "*   **Preserving the original function's metadata**: By using a wrap function, you can preserve the original function's metadata, such as its name, docstring, and argument signature.\n",
      "*   **Improving code readability**: A wrap function can make the decorator code more readable by separating the original function's logic from the decorator's logic.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while a decorator doesn't strictly require a wrap function, using a wrap function is often the best approach to extend the behavior of an original function.\n"
