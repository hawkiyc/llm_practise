      "**Wrap Function in Python (Decorators)**\n",
      "=====================================\n",
      "\n",
      "A wrap function, also known as a decorator, is a design pattern in Python that allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure. It's a way to wrap another function in order to extend the behavior of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Basic Syntax**\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "\n",
      "A decorator is a small function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function that \"wraps\" the original function. The new function produced by the decorator is then called instead of the original function when it's invoked.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def decorator_function(original_function):\n",
      "    def wrapper_function(*args, **kwargs):\n",
      "        # code to be executed before the original function\n",
      "        result = original_function(*args, **kwargs)\n",
      "        # code to be executed after the original function\n",
      "        return result\n",
      "    return wrapper_function\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**How it Works**\n",
      "----------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a step-by-step explanation of how a decorator works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  The interpreter encounters the decorator syntax `@decorator_function` above a function definition.\n",
      "2.  The interpreter then executes the decorator function, passing the original function as an argument.\n",
      "3.  The decorator function returns a new function, which is the wrapper function.\n",
      "4.  The wrapper function is assigned to the original function's name, effectively replacing it.\n",
      "5.  When the original function is called, the wrapper function is executed instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example**\n",
      "-----------\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's create a simple decorator that logs a message before and after the execution of a function:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def logging_decorator(func):\n",
      "    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n",
      "        print(f\"{func.__name__} started\")\n",
      "        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n",
      "        print(f\"{func.__name__} finished\")\n",
      "        return result\n",
      "    return wrapper\n",
      "\n",
      "@logging_decorator\n",
      "def add(a, b):\n",
      "    return a + b\n",
      "\n",
      "result = add(2, 3)\n",
      "print(result)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Output:**\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "add started\n",
      "add finished\n",
      "5\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, the `logging_decorator` function is used to decorate the `add` function. When `add(2, 3)` is called, the `wrapper` function is executed instead, logging messages before and after the execution of the original `add` function.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Real-World Use Cases**\n",
      "------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Decorators have many real-world use cases, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Authentication and Authorization**: Decorators can be used to check if a user is authenticated or authorized to access a certain function.\n",
      "*   **Logging and Debugging**: Decorators can be used to log information about function calls, such as the input arguments and return values.\n",
      "*   **Error Handling**: Decorators can be used to catch and handle exceptions raised by a function.\n",
      "*   **Caching**: Decorators can be used to cache the results of a function, so that the next time it's called with the same input, the cached result can be returned instead of re-executing the function.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Best Practices**\n",
      "------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some best practices to keep in mind when using decorators:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Use a consistent naming convention**: Use a consistent naming convention for your decorators, such as prefixing them with `@`.\n",
      "*   **Keep your decorators simple**: Keep your decorators simple and focused on a single task.\n",
      "*   **Use the `wraps` decorator**: Use the `wraps` decorator from the `functools` module to preserve the metadata of the original function.\n",
      "*   **Test your decorators**: Test your decorators thoroughly to ensure they work as expected.\n"

      "result = add(2, 3)\n",
      "print(result)  # Outputs: 5\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. A decorator that returns a partial function application**\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from functools import partial\n",
      "\n",
      "def partial_decorator(func):\n",
